# ncurses Traffic Lights

##Introduction

Just an interesting project serving as an excuse to learn ncurses that I have
been meaning to do for a long time.

This code observes the sequences seen here in Canada (and elsewhere in North
America), so let's hope I remember the sequences correctly!

I wrote something like this on Windows years ago, and that repo can be found
[here](https://github.com/ButchDean/TrafficLights). It was a game programming
exercise that I created for others.

Anyway, time for more fun!
